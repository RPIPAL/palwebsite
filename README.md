# How to set up and view the website

* Download Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
  
## MongoDB

* Go to MongoDB and sign in using the PAL gmail (rensselaerpal@gmail.com)

* On the top, add your local Network to Mongo (you have to do this everytime the backend doesn't start)

## Starting it up
Pull the repo into local using Github desktop or cmd line

In the terminal after pulling the code to VS code:

  `npm i`
  
  `cd backend`
